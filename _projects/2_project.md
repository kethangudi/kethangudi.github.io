## Premise + Spec
The project's goal was to design and implement a cruise control system for a car. The system would use a PID controller to maintain a set speed, and would be able to adjust the speed based on input from sensors. The project also involved designing and implementing firmware for the car's CAN bus to communicate it's speed and position.
