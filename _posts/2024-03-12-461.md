Experience with Embedded Control Systems:

- Developed a Simulink model to simulate a vehicle equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system.
- Implemented ACC logic to adjust vehicle speed based on surrounding traffic conditions, transitioning between speed and position control modes.
- Utilized haptic wheel as steering input and integrated PID controller for automatic steering along the road.
- Collaborated with team members to interface hardware components including Digital Input/Output, FlexTimer, ADC, and CAN communication for vehicle control and coordination.
- Integrated road geometry and coordinate transforms to accurately model vehicle motion in Simulink environment.
- Successfully configured CAN communication network for exchanging vehicle position and speed data among simulated vehicles.
- Provided support in debugging and optimizing simulation performance for real-time visualization using Windows graphics program.
- Documented system architecture, implemented algorithms, and provided training materials for knowledge transfer within the team.
