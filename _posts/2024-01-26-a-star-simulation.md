- Implemented planning part of autonomous navigation using A-star graph search algorithm.
- Utilized a complete map of the robot's world for A-star algorithm.
- A-star algorithm inferred the shortest path from a start to a goal location in a 2D world with a known map.
- Considered locations in a uniformly spaced, 4-connected grid for A-star search.
- Implemented an admissible heuristic, such as Euclidean distance to the goal.
- Developed a heap data structure as a priority queue for visiting locations in the search grid.
