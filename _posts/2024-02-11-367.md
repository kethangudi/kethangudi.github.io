- Spearheaded the development of physical simulation environments for robotics, facilitating controller testing and training.
- Implemented physical dynamics and servo controllers for a frictionless 1 degree-of-freedom pendulum system.
- Extended project scope to encompass a 2-link, 2-DOF robot arm for advanced graduate-level exploration.
- Demonstrated proficiency in numerical integration methods including Euler's Method and Velocity Verlet.
- Engineered a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for precise motion control in simulated environments.
- Ensured seamless user interaction with functionalities including integrator selection and servo controller toggling.
- Orchestrated robust code implementation and integration to support comprehensive simulation and experimentation.
