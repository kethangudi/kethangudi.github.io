- Spearheaded the implementation of Forward Kinematics (FK) algorithms to enable precise control of robot arm motion.
- Developed FK functionalities allowing prediction of spatial layout and gripper location based on joint configurations.
- Facilitated robot choreography through the creation of Finite State Machine (FSM) controllers and pose setpoints.
- Extended FK implementation to consider angular rotation using quaternions for axis-angle rotation.
- Orchestrated the design and execution of dance routines for robots, integrating P servo control for joint positioning.
